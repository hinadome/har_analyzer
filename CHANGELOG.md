# Changelog

## [0.1.1]

### Changed

- **Content Diff binary fallback now compares by SHA-256 hash** — previously, when at least one of the two selected entries had a binary content type or no captured response body, the fallback panel only displayed byte sizes, leaving users with no way to tell whether two binary responses were equal. The panel now asynchronously computes the SHA-256 hash of each side's stored `responseContent` (via the Web Crypto API, `crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-256", …)`) and renders both 64-character hex digests side-by-side along with the byte sizes. A status banner reports the comparison result:
  - **Identical (matching SHA-256)** — both hashes equal
  - **Different (SHA-256 mismatch)** — hashes differ
  - **Computing SHA-256…** — digest is in flight
  - **No body captured for {baseline | compare | either entry}** — `responseContent` is missing on at least one side (common for binary bodies in many HAR exporters)
  - **Hash error: …** — `crypto.subtle` is unavailable (e.g. non-secure dev context)

### Added

- **`sha256Hex(text: string): Promise<string>`** in `utils/contentDiff.ts` — UTF-8-encodes the input, runs it through `crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-256", …)`, and returns a lowercase hex digest. Throws when the Web Crypto API is unavailable. Used by the binary fallback panel; reusable elsewhere.

### Tests

- Added 6 tests in `__tests__/contentDiff.test.ts` covering `sha256Hex`: NIST canonical vectors for the empty string and `"abc"`, hex-format shape (`/^[0-9a-f]{64}$/`), equality of equal inputs, inequality of different inputs, and large-input correctness.

### Added

- **Cross-file performance dashboard (`/performance`)** — overview page laying every loaded HAR file out side by side:
  - Per-file KPI matrix (total requests, P50/P95/P99 response time, total bytes, error rate) rendered as horizontal bars on a shared per-metric scale so visual length is directly comparable across files
  - Average timing-phase comparison (DNS, Connect, SSL, Send, TTFB, Receive) on a shared millisecond axis
  - Response-time distribution histogram with a shared bucket axis (linear / log toggle) so each file's request-count-per-bucket can be eyeballed against the others
  - Per-content-type performance table (count, total bytes, avg time, p95 time) grouped by file
  - Combined Slowest / Largest top-N lists across all files with file color chips and deep links to the per-file view filtered to the URL
  - File color legend that doubles as a discovery surface for the pair-diff dashboard once ≥ 2 files are loaded
- **Pair diff dashboard (`/performance/diff`)** — dedicated head-to-head comparison page for any two loaded files. Sections:
  - Headline KPI Δ cards with absolute delta + % change and tinted regression/improvement cues (`deltaTone` semantics: lower-is-better for time/bytes/errors)
  - Per-phase timing Δ chart on a shared axis (Base in baseline color, Compare in compare color, Δ labelled per phase)
  - Overlaid 2-color response-time distribution histogram with shared buckets and a linear / log scale toggle
  - Per-content-type Δ table with grouped headers (Count · Bytes · Avg time · p95 time, each split into Base / Cmp / Δ), sortable columns, default sort by `|Δavg time|` desc
  - Biggest Movers — top 10 by `|Δtime|` and top 10 by `|Δsize|`, drawn from URLs present in both runs
  - Top 10 Regressions and top 10 Improvements (one-directional, time-based) with per-URL median, signed Δ, and % change
  - "Only in Base" and "Only in Compare" unique-URL listings, each row deep-linking into the per-file view filtered to that URL
  - Path-mode / Full-URL match-key toggle persisted in the query string alongside `base`, `cmp`, and `scale`
- **"Compare two runs →" discovery links** — added to the home page and the cross-file performance dashboard (visible only when ≥ 2 files are loaded), navigating to `/performance/diff`
- **Per-file view URL search seeding** — `app/file/[index]/page.tsx` now accepts a `?search=` query parameter and pre-populates its filter input with that value, enabling deep links from the diff dashboard's unique-URL lists
- **Performance helper utilities (`utils/perfStats.ts`, `utils/perfFormat.ts`)** — shared math and formatting layer used by both performance pages: percentile/median, timing-phase averages, shared-bucket histogram, content-type aggregation, regressions/improvements, content-type Δ, plus `formatDelta`, `formatPctChange`, and `deltaTone`
- **Sample HAR fixtures (`sample-hars/sample-a.har`, `sample-b.har`, `sample-c.har`)** — small fixture set used for manual verification of the pair diff flows

### Changed

- **`next` upgraded to `^16.2.5`** (from `^16.2.4`) — minor patch bump
- **`next.config.ts`** — added `127.50.100.1` to `allowedDevOrigins` for local development from a non-loopback address
- **`README.md`** — new feature bullets and usage steps for the cross-file dashboard and pair diff dashboard, expanded directory-tree section listing `app/performance/`, `utils/perfStats.ts`, and `utils/perfFormat.ts`
- **`spec.md`** — added §4.10 (Cross-file Dashboard) and §4.11 (Pair Diff Dashboard) describing layout, query-string state, and computed metrics; pipe characters inside backtick'd table cells escaped (`\|`) so GFM tables render correctly
- **`DEPLOYMENT.md`** — step list now states the Next.js 16 minimum Node version (20.9+), the standalone-asset copy step, and the env-var-based PM2 invocation

### Fixed

- **`deploy-vm.sh` broken standalone deployment** — the script ran `npm run build` and started PM2 against `.next/standalone/server.js` without copying `public/` and `.next/static/` into `.next/standalone/`, which would have caused 404s for every JS chunk and every `public/` asset in production. Both first-time and `--update` paths now run `cp -r public .next/standalone/ && cp -r .next/static .next/standalone/.next/` after the build, matching the Next.js 16 standalone docs and the existing `Dockerfile` behaviour.
- **`deploy-vm.sh` PORT/HOSTNAME ignored by the standalone server** — the standalone `server.js` reads `process.env.PORT` and `process.env.HOSTNAME`, not argv, so the previous `pm2 start … -- --port "$PORT"` form was silently dropped (only working because `3000` is the default). The script now exports `NODE_ENV=production PORT="$PORT" HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0` before invoking `pm2 start`, and `pm2 restart` in `--update` mode now passes `--update-env` so env changes propagate on redeploy.

### Tests

- Added `__tests__/perfStats.test.ts` covering percentile, median, timing-phase average, histogram bucket assignment, content-type aggregation, regressions/improvements, and content-type Δ helpers
- Added `__tests__/perfFormat.test.ts` covering `formatDelta`, `formatPctChange`, and `deltaTone` semantics for lower-is-better, higher-is-better, and neutral metrics

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- **Content Diff page (`/content-diff`)** — new page for comparing response body content across HAR entries for the same URL. Features:
  - URL search with live filtering and grouped dropdown (base path as header, full URLs with query strings as sub-items)
  - "Ignore query string" toggle — groups entries by base path so requests to the same endpoint with different query params can be compared side by side
  - Entry table showing HAR file name, full URL (clickable — links to `/compare` page), status, content type, size, and UTC timestamp per entry
  - Baseline / Compare radio selection for any two entries
  - Unified and side-by-side diff modes with line numbers
  - Intra-line character/word-level highlighting on changed lines
  - JSON auto-prettification (2-space indent) before diffing for `application/json` and `+json` content types
  - "Identical" banner when both response bodies match exactly
  - Binary/missing content fallback showing size comparison instead of diff
  - Large payload truncation at 50,000 characters with per-entry "Show full content" toggle
  - Pre-populated via `?url=` query parameter when navigating from the compare page
  - Baseline / Compare metadata cards shown above the diff panel (HAR file name, full URL, status, UTC timestamp)
- **Header Diff page (`/header-diff`)** — new page for comparing request/response headers and cookies between any two HAR entries for the same URL. Features:
  - Same URL search, grouped dropdown, and "Ignore query string" toggle as the Content Diff page
  - Entry table showing HAR file, full URL (links to `/compare`), status, req/res header counts, req/res cookie counts, and UTC timestamp
  - Baseline / Compare radio selection for any two entries
  - Four diff sections: Request Headers, Response Headers, Request Cookies, Response Cookies
  - Color-coded key-value diff table: red `−` for removed, green `+` for added, amber `~` for changed (old value struck through, new value highlighted), no highlight for equal
  - Header names compared case-insensitively per HTTP spec; values compared case-sensitively
  - Multi-value headers matched positionally per name
  - "Identical" banner when all four sections match exactly
  - Metadata bar showing both selected entries (file, URL, status, timestamp) before the diff
  - Pre-populated via `?url=` query parameter
- **"Header Diff" link on compare page** — button added next to "Content Diff" in the URL title area, navigating to `/header-diff?url={encoded}`
- **Sample HAR files** (`sample-hars/`) — three sample files for testing: `sample-a.har` (baseline), `sample-b.har` (modified responses for diffing), `sample-c.har` (query string variants and status changes)

### Fixed

- **Cell zero-value rendering** — `ComparisonTable` now correctly renders `0` for entries with a zero count. Previously `if (!value)` treated `0` as falsy and showed `—` instead.
- **Search filter missing file name field** — The filter input on details pages now matches against the HAR file name in addition to URL, content type, and status code, consistent with the functional spec §4.1.
- **`formatBytes` HAR sentinel handling** — Negative values (e.g. `bodySize: -1`, the HAR spec sentinel for "unknown") now return `'N/A'` instead of `'0 B'`, making unknown sizes visually distinct from genuine zero-byte responses.
- **Unused import removed** — `useSyncExternalStore` was imported but never used in `app/compare/page.tsx`.
- **Duplicate Tailwind dark-mode classes** — Removed conflicting `dark:text-*` utility pairs across `app/page.tsx`, `app/details/page.tsx`, `app/compare/page.tsx`, and `components/ComparisonTable.tsx` where earlier declarations were silently overridden by later ones on the same element.

### Improved

- **`allEntries` memoization** — `store?.analyses.flatMap(...)` in `app/details/page.tsx` and `app/compare/page.tsx` is now wrapped in `useMemo([store])`, avoiding unnecessary recomputation on unrelated re-renders (e.g. sort/page state changes).
- **`HarTimings` type deduplication** — `HarEntry.timings` now references the shared `HarTimings` interface rather than repeating an identical anonymous inline type, so the timing shape is defined in exactly one place.

### Tests

- Added Vitest + `@testing-library/react` test suite (`__tests__/`)
- Bug condition exploration tests confirming all three behavioural bugs were present before fixes
- Preservation property tests locking in correct baseline behaviour as a regression guard
- Property-based tests (via `fast-check`) for `contentDiff.ts` utilities covering identity detection, diff line classification, line number assignment, intra-line span reconstruction, JSON prettification round-trip, and truncation correctness
